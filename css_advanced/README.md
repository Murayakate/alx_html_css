# CSS Advanced Project

This repository contains the `index.html` file and associated stylesheets for the CSS Advanced project. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a deep understanding of modern and advanced CSS techniques to create a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing web page.

## About `index.html`

The `index.html` file serves as the structural backbone of the webpage. It is crafted using semantic HTML5 tags to ensure accessibility and provide a clear, logical document outline for both browsers and developers.

### Key Structural Components:

*   **`<header>`**: Contains the main navigation, logo, and introductory content.
*   **`<main>`**: The primary content of the page, divided into logical `<section>` elements.
    *   Each section is designed to showcase a specific piece of content, such as "About Us," "Services," or "Testimonials."
*   **`<footer>`**: Includes closing information, social media links, and copyright details.

## Advanced CSS Techniques Implemented

The styling for `index.html` leverages a variety of advanced CSS concepts to achieve a modern and responsive layout.

*   **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)**: Used for maintaining a consistent design system (colors, fonts, spacing) and allowing for easy theme management.
*   **Flexbox & Grid**: Employed for creating complex, responsive layouts for major page components and content alignment.
*   **Responsive Design**: Media queries are used extensively to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
*   **Transitions & Animations**: Subtle animations and transitions are added to enhance user experience and provide visual feedback for interactive elements.
*   **Advanced Selectors**: Utilizes pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to style elements with precision without adding extra classes to the HTML.
